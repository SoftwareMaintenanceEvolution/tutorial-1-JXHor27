# Introduction
Hi! I'm Hor Ji Xuan, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course.
I expect to learn about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems with legacy codebase, which has low readability.
- **Fun fact**: I love playing basketball and swimming in my free time.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in maintaining and evolving software, especially for my final year project.
